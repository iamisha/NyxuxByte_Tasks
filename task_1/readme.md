# Day 1 Task 1

1.  Write a program that takes a number as input from the user and   prints all the even numbers up to that number using a loop and conditional statement.

2. Create a guessing game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. Use a loop to give the user 3 attempts, and provide hints(higher/lower) based on their guesses until they get it right.

3. Write a program that takes N numbers as input from a user and puts them in a list. Then the program should find out the sum of all the odd numbers and the sum of all the even numbers from the list and print them out.

4. Develop a program that takes a sentence from the user and counts the number of vowels in it using a loop and conditional statement.

5. Design a simple calculator that asks the user for two numbers and an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and performs the calculation using conditional statements and user input.
